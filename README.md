# BCMS UI

## Development

- Create `bcms.db.json` with empty object in the root of
  the project.
- Create empty `uploads` directory.

- Install dependencies with: `npm i`

- If you don't have docker installed and running, install
  it and run it.
- If you don't have docker-compose installed, install it.

- Start development by running `docker-compose up`.

- While in development, if you install new dependency or
  change any file outside the `src` directory, you will need
  to run `docker-compose build` command
